I am developer from Shenyang, China.

The owner of the freelancer account Ander is my partnership who live in Sydney now. I have worked with him for almost 2 years. 
So I have known about him very deeply. So I borrowed his account a month ago.

As you see, I am 28 years old, but I looks like very young and from clients standpoint they looks like not professional. 
So I decided to borrow his account because he looks like professional.
I request to him and he is very closet with me. So he agreed easily my offer.
I think that the face is very important factor for freelancer.

I have graduated from Shenyang University of technology at 2018.
So um... I have been developing with ReactJS, NodeJS, Laravel for almost 6 years. So your requirements you sent yesterday was no problem for me. 
I wanna build the best project with you.
Especially, ReactJS and ExpressJS are my major skills.

I am really confident about reactjs and expressJS. So if you want, I can do anything. 
I think that the trust and results and relationship are the most three factors for our relationship and our project for the future.
