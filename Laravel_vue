Good day,
First of all, thank you for evaluating my skills and inviting me to your project.
My main job is to develop custom websites/applications, upgrade and improve the work on existing projects, and support if the client needs it. All this is based on PHP/JS and their main frameworks Laravel.

Everything in your offer looks affordable and suitable for me, but unfortunately, I am already a member of the Tunelab team, and I will be able to help you only on specific projects, not on a full-time basis. We have already had experience working with other teams, and we have successfully implemented several projects together.

If this type of collaboration is right for you, we will be glad to help you with your projects.

Here are examples of our projects in different types of businesses:

We would be delighted to start a collaboration with you, feel free to ask any questions and write if you are interested.
