ðŸ“ŒðŸ“Œ THE STRATEGY FOR YOUR PROJECT ðŸ“ŒðŸ“Œ
1. SEO
I will optimize your website for local search. I will update your Google Business Profile with accurate information about your location, hours, services, and contact details. This will help search engines provide relevant results to users searching for local businesses.
2. Increase follow number
Use relevant hashtags: Hashtags help increase the discoverability of your posts. I will use a mixture of hashtags that are relevant to your content, caption, and business.
3. Speed
- I wil compress and resize images to reduce their file size without sacrificing quality. I will use image formats that are suitable for the web, such as JPEG or PNG. Additionally, I will consider lazy loading images, which means loading images only when they are visible on the user's screen. 
- I will minify and combine JavaScript and CSS files to reduce the number of HTTP requests made by the browser.
