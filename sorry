Hello,
I am the owner of this telegram just.
I apologize for the past actions.
Actually, my younger brother did something bad using my cell phone.
I went on a business trip and returned home yesterday.
And I heard about it from him.
In fact, he is a beginner as a freelancer and programmer.
So I think he failed in that project.
I hope you understand him.
If I misunderstood, I apologize on your behalf.
I think you are an honest person.
I am an honest developer(3D) too.
If you need my help, please tell me anytime.
I will help you enough.
I am very interested for you and your team.
I am a person who values trust more than money.
I am looking forward to working with you.
Anyway, I am sorry and thanks.
