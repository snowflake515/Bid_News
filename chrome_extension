Hello,
I hope this message finds you well. 
I am a software developer with expertise in Google Chrome extension development. 
I have carefully reviewed the project description and I am confident that I can assist you in creating a Google Chrome Extension 

to extract content from a web page and store it in a Google Sheet.

I have extensive experience in working with Google Chrome extensions and I am proficient in JavaScript, which is the primary language used for developing Chrome extensions. 
I have also worked with Google Cloud Platform and OAuth tokens, so I am well-equipped to handle the integration with Google Sheets.
Based on the requirements you have provided, I am open to discussing a fixed price for the project if that is your preference.
I am committed to delivering high-quality work and ensuring that the extension meets all of your requirements.
I am available to work remotely and I am confident that my skills and experience make me the ideal candidate for this project.
Thank you for considering my bid. 
I look forward to the opportunity to work with you.
Best regards,
Robert.
