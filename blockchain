Dear Sir.
I am a blockchain engineer with a deep knowledge of solidity/Rust/Cosmwasm/Meataplex/web3.js.

I can develop a frontend which interacts with smart contracts using web3.js or ethers.js as well.
The last time, I've worked on several NFT & Defi-related projects, so I have rich experience in developing DApps, and that's why I am willing to show you some of my projects via private chat.
