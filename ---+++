Hello sir, nice to meet you here.
Your project is no problem for me. I will complete the project as quickly and perfectly as possible. After I finish the project, I will continue to fix and update your project for free until you feel satisfied. However, I have a concern. As you know, freelancing fees are quite expensive and this isn't a small sum for me. I believe you can understand easily. Thank you for your understanding. My contact information includes

No worries. After reading my suggestions, please send me "NoNo". Then I will remove these sentences before the freelancer support team reads them.
