Hello

I read your job description carefully and am pretty sure that I am perfect fit for this project.

- I am an experienced React Native developer with 8+ years of experience.
- I have a strong background in building cross-platform mobile applications.
- I can commit to completing the project within the specified timeline of 1 month.

I have experience in handling projects with a significant number of screens, and your requirement of 50 screens will be effectively managed and implemented with a focus on user experience and performance.

- I have experience in user authentication and API integration.
- I have successfully delivered various mobile applications on both iOS and Android platforms.
- I am proficient in implementing secure and reliable authentication methods.
- I can ensure that your app is optimized for performance and functionality across both operating systems.

I’m now available 40 hours a week and can be available anytime for a discussion. I provide you 1 month's free technical support after project completion.
Let’s connect through chat for further detailed discussion. I can start the work right after the discussion.
Waiting for your valuable response.
Thanks and Regards
Louis Robinson
