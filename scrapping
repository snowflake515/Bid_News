Dear client

I have rich experience in web scrapping and automation using Python selenium and scrapy.
Recently, I scrapped a complex hospital website and collected patients' data automatically.
You can see the process of automation here.

Here, I logged in to a hospital management platform, first. And searched data by patient name and exported as a PDF file format.
Also, here are some of my previous work.

Here, I developed a bot that can log in to p2p.binance.com and accept buy orders automatically by using Python selenium.
I can scrape your data and save it as a CSV file.
I can start working immediately and complete it ASAP.
I hope to talk in detail with you.
Best regards.
